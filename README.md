# Zerto9x-LTR-IAM-Policy
This is an updated IAM Policy JSON file for Zerto 9.0.  These permissions are needed in order to take advantage of Amazon S3 as a Zerto 9.0 Long-term Retention Repository.  Additional permissions were added to accommodate for new features that include auto-tiering of retention set data to S3-IA and S3-Glacier along with Immutability via Amazon S3 Object Lock.
